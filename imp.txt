well lets take a big picture whats happening actually

when you run your kernel in qemu:

laptop
 └── qemu (pretends to be a risc-v machine)
      └── OpenSBI (firmware, like bios/uefi)
           └── kernel

and thats not a normal program thats the first software layer that runs after firmware


firstly why we made run.sh
because initially there is no OS so 
there is not PATH variable, no file system, no loader, no compiler nothing ...
so run.sh is like a deterministic contract .. like this is the exact compiler, this is the exact loader etcetc


when a cpu starts there is no RAM configured, no stack, no console etc etc 
your kernel expects RAM to exists and some way to print and debug or some stuff like that

so OpenSBI does that only ... its a firmware tho .. not a part of os 
it sets up machine mode stuff and switches to supervisor mode ..
 
inshort without OpenSBI your kernel wont run
